java script:
it waas founded by marc andreessen in the year of 1995 may,
first it was called as mocha and later it's renamed as live script and again it's renamed as javascript in the 
year of 1995 december.  
*.javascrit is not compiled language, but it is a translated language 

Application of java script:
1.client side validation
2.Dynamic drop-down menus
3.Displaying data and time
4.displaying pop -up windows and dialog boxesu(like an alert dialog box,confirm dialog box ad prompt dialog box)
5.Displaying clocks etc. 

Features of javascript:
1.All web browsers support javaScript as they built-in execution environments
2.javascript follows thwe syntaxs and structure of the C programming language
3.javascript is weakly-typed language
4.javascript is a objected oriented language
5.it is a light-weighted languagea and interpreted language
6.javascript is a case sensitive language
7.javascript is supported in several operating systems including,windows,macOS etc
8.it provides good control to the users over  the web browsers

javascript example:
it is easy to code.javascript provides 3 places to put the javascript code 
1.within body tag 
2.within head tag
3.external javascript files

Ex:
<html>
<body>   
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("javascript is a simple language for javapoint learners");
</script>
</body>
</html>

*.script tag(<script> </scrippt>) specifies theat we are using javascript.
*.the "text/javascript" is the content type tha provides information to the browser about the data.
*. the "document.write()" funtion is used to display dynamic content through javascript.
  
External javascript file:
we can create external javascript filean embed it in many html page.
*.it provides r"re usability because single javascript file can be used in several html psges.
*.external javascript file must be saved by ".js" extention.it is recommended to embed all jvascript filesin to single file.it
increases the speed of the webpage.

                                     /*************************javascript Basics*******************************/
A).Javascript Comment:
the javascript comments are meaningful way to deliver the message.it is used to add the information about the code, warnings or 
suggetions so that end user can easily interpret the code.
*.javascript comments is ignored by the javascript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.

Advantages of javascript comments:
there are mainly to advantages of javascript  comments.
1.To make code easy to understand it can used to elaborated the code so that code so that end user can easily understand the code.
2.To avoid the unnessasary code it can also be to avoid code being  executed.sometimes, we add the code to perform some action,but
after sometime, there may be need to disable the code.im such case,it is better to use comments.

Types of javascript comments:
there are two tyoes of js comments,they are
1.Single-line comment
2.Multi-line comment

1).JS Single-line comment:
it is represented by double forward slashes "//". it can be used before and after statement.  

Ex:
<script>
//hi this Bhargav
document.write("hello Bhargav");   //before statement//
</script>

<script>

document.write("hello Bhargav");//hi this Bhargav   //this is after statement//
</script>


2).JS Multi-line comment:
It can be used to add singl and multi line comments.so ,it is more convenient.

B).Javascript Variable:
A javascript variable is simply a name of storage location.there are two types of variables 
1.Local variable
2.Global variable

*.there are some rules while declaring the javascript variable (also known as identifiers).

1).Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z),underscore(_),or doller($) sign.
2).After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9).
3).javascript variables are case sensitive,for example x and X are different variables.   
 

1).local variable:
A Javascript local variable is declared inside block or function.it is accessible within the function or block only.
 Ex:
<script>
function abc (){
var x=10;//local variable
 }
</script>

or

<script>
if(10>3){
var y=20;//Javascript local variable
}
</script>

2).Javascript Global variable:
A Javascript global varible is accessable from function.A variable i.e. declared out side the function or declared with window
object is known as global variable.

Ex:
<script>  
var data=200;//gloabal variable  
function a(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}                                           o/p: 200 200
function b(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
a();//calling JavaScript function  
b();  
</script>  

C).Javascript Data types:
 javascript provides different data types to hold different types of values.there are two types of data types in javascript .

1.primitive data type
2.Non primitive data type

*.javascript is a dynamic type language,means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by 
javascript engine.you need to use "var" here to specify the data type. it can hold any values such as numbers,strings etc.

Ex:
var a=10;//number
var b="hi there";//string

1.Javascript primitive data types:
there are five types of primitive data types in javascript.

a.string   :Represents sequence of character ex:"hi"
b.number   :Represents numeric values ex:100
c.boolean  :Represents boolean values either false or true
d.undefined:Represents undefined values
e.null     :Represents null i.e. no value at all

2.Non-primitive data type:
 there are three types 
1.Object :repersents instance through which we can access members
2.Array  :represents group of similar values 
3.RegExp :represents regular expression

D).JS Operators:
Javascript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands 
ex: vr sum=10+20;
there are following types of operators in javascript.

a.Arthmetic Operators
b.Comparison operators
c.bitwise operators
d.logical operators
e.assignment operators
f.special operators

a. Arthmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.

Operator	Description	       Example
+	        Addition	       10+20 = 30
-	       Subtraction	       20-10 = 10
*	      Multiplication	       10*20 = 200
/	        Division	       20/10 = 2
%	     Modulus (Remainder)       20%10 = 0
++	       Increment	       var a=10; a++; Now a = 11
--	       Decrement	       var a=10; a--; Now a = 9

b.Comparision Operators:

The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:

Operator	Description	                          Example
==	       Is equal to	                        10==20 = false
===	      Identical (equal and of same type)	10==20 = false
!=	       Not equal to	                        10!=20 = true
!==	       Not Identical	                        20!==20 = false
>	       Greater than	                        20>10 = true
>=	       Greater than or equal to	                20>=10 = true
<	        Less than	                        20<10 = false
<=	     Less than or equal to	                20<=10 = false


c.bitwise operator:
& -bitwise AND
| -bitwise OR
> -bitwise XOR
~ -bitwise NOT
<< -bitwise leftshift
>> -bitwise rightshift
>>> -bitwise rightshift with zero

d.logical operator:
&& -logical AND
|| -logical OR
!  -logical NOT
 
E).Loops:
the javascript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for,while,do while or for-in loops.it makes the code compact.
it mostly used in array.

there are 4 types of lopps in javascript.
1.for loop
2.while loop
3.do-while loop
4. for-in loop

1.javascript for loop:
the javascript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times.it should be used if number of iteration is known.

for(initialization; condition; increment)
{

 }


F).JS function:
JS functions are used to perform the operations.we can call javascript function many times to reuse the code.

Advantages of JS function:
1."code reusability":we can call a unction many times so it save the coding.
2."Less coding":it makes our program compact.we don't need to write many lines of the code each time to perform a common task.

*.javascript function can have 0 or more arguments.
Ex:
<html>
<body>
<script>  
function msg(){  
alert("hello! this is message");  
}                                                                      
</script>  
<input type="button" onclick="msg()" value="call function"/>  
</body>
</html>

a).JS function arguments:
we can call function by pasing the arguments.

Ex:
<body>
<script>  
function getcube(number){  
alert(number*number*number);  
}  
</script>  
<form>  
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="getcube(4)"/>  
</form>  
</body>
</html>
b).function with return value:
we can call the function that returns a value and use it in our program.

Ex:<html>
<body>
<script>  
function getInfo(){  
return "hello javatpoint! How r u?";  
}  
</script>  
<script>  
document.write(getInfo());  
</script>  
</body>
</html>

c).JS function object:
In JavaScript, the purpose of Function constructor is to create a new Function object. It executes the code globally. However, ]
if we call the constructor directly, a function is created dynamically but in an unsecured way.

methods:
Method	     Description
apply()	    It is used to call a function contains this value and a single array of arguments.
bind()	    It is used to create a new function.
call()	    It is used to call a function contains this value and an argument list.
toString()  It returns the result in a form of a string.

                       /******************************************JavaScript Objects ******************************************/
A).javascript object:
  A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

*.JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.
*.JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

Creating objects in javascript:
there are 3 ways to create objects.
1.by object literal.
2.by creating instance of object directly (using new keyword)
3.by using an obect constructor (using new keyword)

1).javascript object by object literal:
the syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  
 property and value are separated by :(colon).
ex:
<html>
<body>
<script>  
emp={id:102,name:"Shyam Kumar",salary:40000}  
document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
</script>
</body>
</html>
2).by creating instance of objects:
var objectname=new Object();  this is how to create a instace of object.
new keyword is used to creat object.
Ex:
<html>
<body>
<script>  
var emp=new Object();  
emp.id=101;  
emp.name="Ravi Malik";  
emp.salary=50000;  
document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
</script> 
</body>
</html>
3).by using an object constructor:
first we need to function with argumennts.each argument value casn be assigned in the current object by using "this keyword".
this keyword refers to the current object.
Ex:
<html>
<body>
<script>  
function emp(id,name,salary){  
this.id=id;  
this.name=name;  
this.salary=salary;  
}  
e=new emp(103,"Vimal Jaiswal",30000);  
  
document.write(e.id+" "+e.name+" "+e.salary);  
</script>  
</body>
</html>
